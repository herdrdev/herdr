Use only when the user explicitly mentions Herdr or asks to use Herdr to inspect or control panes, tabs, workspaces, commands, or another agent. Do not use merely because a task could benefit from a background terminal, delegation, or parallel work. Requires HERDR_ENV=1."

# Herdr

Herdr organizes terminals into workspaces, tabs, and panes, recognizes coding agents running inside panes, and exposes the current session through the `herdr` CLI.

Before issuing any control command, verify that this agent is running inside a Herdr-managed pane:

```bash
test "${HERDR_ENV:-}" = 1
```

If the check fails, say that you are not running inside Herdr and stop. Do not inspect or control the focused Herdr session from outside Herdr.

When the check passes, the `herdr` binary in `PATH` talks to the current session. Use it to inspect neighboring work, create terminal layout, start agents and commands, read output, and wait for state changes.

## Learn the current CLI

The installed binary is the authority for command syntax. Start with:

```bash
herdr --help
```

Then print the relevant command group by running the group without a subcommand:

```bash
herdr agent
herdr pane
herdr workspace
herdr tab
herdr worktree
herdr terminal
herdr notification
herdr integration
herdr session
```

Do not run bare `herdr` for discovery; it launches or attaches the TUI. Do not probe a mutating nested command by omitting arguments. Commands such as `herdr workspace create` are valid with defaults and will execute.

Most control commands return JSON. Read identifiers and state from those responses instead of predicting them.

## Understand layout, panes, and agents

Choose the primitive that matches the job:

- Workspace, tab, and pane topology organize terminal locations.
- Pane commands control raw terminals, shells, tests, servers, input, and output.
- Agent commands control the recognized coding agent currently occupying a pane.

A pane exists whether or not it contains an agent. `agent start` requires an existing available shell pane and never creates, splits, or moves layout. Use pane commands for ordinary processes. Use agent commands when Herdr must validate agent identity or interpret `idle`, `working`, `blocked`, `done`, and `unknown` lifecycle states.

Agent commands accept either a unique live agent name or the pane ID currently hosting that agent. They do not accept terminal IDs or bare agent-kind labels. Names must match `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}` and be unique among live agents. A name follows the current pane occupant and is cleared when that agent exits, is released, or is replaced.

`idle` means the agent is ready for input and its tab has been seen in the focused Herdr UI. `done` is the same underlying idle state after unseen background work finishes. Focusing the tab or targeting the pane or agent with a focus command marks it seen. CLI reads do not mark it seen. `blocked` means Herdr recognized an approval or question UI. `unknown` means an agent is present but Herdr cannot classify it confidently; it does not prove completion.

## Use IDs and caller context

Public IDs are opaque stable handles:

- workspace: `w1`
- tab: `w1:t1`
- pane: `w1:p1`

Closed tab and pane IDs are not reused. A pane moved into another workspace receives a new workspace-qualified pane ID. After `pane move`, continue with `.result.move_result.pane.pane_id` or the live agent name. The old value is reported as `.result.move_result.previous_pane_id`; only the moved process's inherited caller context keeps resolving that old ID, so do not use it as a general agent target.

Herdr injects the caller's context into each managed pane:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID" "$HERDR_TAB_ID" "$HERDR_PANE_ID"
```

Prefer `--current` when a pane command should target the calling pane. Omitting a target may use the UI-focused pane, which can belong to the user or another client.

Discover live state with:

```bash
herdr workspace list
herdr tab list --workspace "$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID"
herdr pane current --current
herdr pane list --workspace "$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID"
herdr agent list
```

Creation responses expose the IDs to use next. `workspace create` returns `.result.workspace`, `.result.tab`, and `.result.root_pane`. `tab create` returns `.result.tab` and `.result.root_pane`. `pane split` returns the new pane as `.result.pane`.

## Start and coordinate an agent

Default to a sibling pane in the current tab and the current working directory. Do not create a workspace, tab, worktree, or different cwd unless the user explicitly requests that topology or location.

Honor a direction requested by the user. Otherwise inspect the caller pane:

```bash
herdr pane layout --pane "$HERDR_PANE_ID"
```

Split a wide pane to the right and a narrow or tall pane down. Avoid repeated same-direction splits that create unusably narrow columns or short rows. Keep the user's focus in the calling pane and explicitly preserve the caller's working directory:

```bash
herdr pane split --current --direction right --cwd "$PWD" --no-focus
```

Replace `right` with `down` when appropriate. Read the new pane ID from `.result.pane.pane_id`.

An available shell pane must be at its interactive prompt, with the shell itself in the foreground and no foreground command, editor, or agent running. Start a supported agent in that pane with a useful unique name:

```bash
herdr agent start reviewer --kind codex --pane <returned-pane-id>
```

Use the kind requested by the user. Run `herdr agent` to inspect the installed kind list and options. Pass native agent arguments only after `--`:

```bash
herdr agent start reviewer --kind codex --pane <returned-pane-id> -- <agent-args...>
```

`agent start` returns only after Herdr detects the expected agent in the same pane and considers it ready for interactive input. It defaults to a 30-second startup timeout.

Submit work through the agent surface:

```bash
herdr agent prompt reviewer "Review the current diff and report only actionable findings." --wait --timeout 120000
```

`agent prompt` atomically submits text and encoded Enter while honoring the pane's live bracketed-paste mode. For normal agent work, `--wait` is enough: it waits for the first settled `idle`, `done`, or `blocked` state. Do not repeat those defaults with `--until`.

A prompt sent from a non-working state must produce an observed lifecycle change within five seconds. Otherwise Herdr returns `agent_prompt_stalled` instead of waiting indefinitely. This wait tracks lifecycle state, not an individual turn; if the agent is already working, completion of the active turn may satisfy it.

Use `--until` only for a state-specific workflow, such as waiting for an already-running agent to request input:

```bash
herdr agent wait reviewer --until blocked --timeout 120000
```

Without `--until`, standalone `agent wait` uses the same settled-state defaults as `agent prompt --wait`.

Use logical keys for interactive agent UI controls:

```bash
herdr agent send-keys reviewer esc
herdr agent send-keys reviewer ctrl+c
```

Herdr validates all keys before writing any bytes. Read the result through the resolved agent:

```bash
herdr agent get reviewer
herdr agent read reviewer --source recent-unwrapped --lines 120
```

If a wait fails or returns `blocked`, inspect `agent get` and `agent read` before deciding what input to send. Use the pane surface only when raw terminal control is intentional.

## Run an ordinary command in another pane

Create a sibling pane with the same geometry rule, preserve the caller's working directory, and keep user focus unchanged:

```bash
herdr pane split --current --direction right --cwd "$PWD" --no-focus
```

Read the new pane ID from `.result.pane.pane_id`, then run and inspect the command:

```bash
herdr pane run <returned-pane-id> "just test"
herdr pane wait-output <returned-pane-id> --match "test result" --timeout 120000
herdr pane read <returned-pane-id> --source recent-unwrapped --lines 120
```

`pane run` atomically sends command text and Enter. `pane wait-output` searches the selected snapshot immediately, so output that already exists can match. Use `--match <text>` for a literal substring or `--regex <pattern>` for a Rust regular expression. Omitting `--timeout` allows an indefinite wait.

Use the read source that matches the task:

- `visible`: the currently rendered viewport.
- `recent`: recent rendered output, including soft wraps.
- `recent-unwrapped`: recent output with soft wraps joined; prefer it for logs and transcripts.
- `detection`: the plain-text bottom-buffer snapshot used for agent detection.

Use `--format ansi` when colors and terminal styling are evidence. Otherwise use text.

`--lines` asks Herdr for more rows from the pane's available screen and host scrollback. If increasing it does not reveal more of a completed response, the pane is probably running the agent on the terminal's alternate screen. Rows that leave the alternate screen do not enter Herdr's host scrollback, so a larger line count cannot recover them.

After that failed read, ask the agent to write its complete response as Markdown in a temporary directory and reply only with the file path, then read the file directly. Use this only as a fallback; do not request file output in the initial prompt.

## Safety and coordination rules

- Use `--no-focus` for background work unless the user asked to switch context.
- Use `--current`, an explicit pane ID, or a unique agent name. Do not rely on another client's focused pane.
- Parse IDs from JSON responses. Do not derive them from sidebar order or examples.
- Do not close workspaces, tabs, panes, or sessions you did not create unless the user explicitly asked.
- Never run `herdr server stop` from an active session unless the user explicitly intends to stop the server and its pane processes.
- Never kill the main Herdr process. Use named test sessions for experiments that need an isolated server.
- CLI server errors are JSON on stderr with exit status 1. CLI syntax errors exit with status 2.
